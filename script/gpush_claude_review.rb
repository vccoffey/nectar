  Run `gpush diff-branch` first. It should return exactly one git branch name (the
  base branch).

  Then review changes from that base to HEAD using:
  - `git diff <base>...HEAD`
  - `git log <base>..HEAD`
  - `git show <sha>` when needed for context

  Use the git commit messages to inform your review.

  Review for:
  - Bugs and regressions
  - Typos
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Violations of repo conventions
  - Anything that should block commit

  Do not report low-value style nits.

  Format your output for a terminal — plain text, no markdown. Use blank lines for
  separation and dashes for bullet points.

  - For each finding include:
    - Severity: HIGH | MEDIUM | LOW
    - Location: `path/to/file:line` (or range)
    - Issue: what is wrong
    - Fix: exact recommended change

  If no issues:
  - Print exactly: `APPROVED: no blocking issues found.`

  The final line must be the word EXIT followed by a number; exactly one of:
  - `EXIT 0` (no changes needed)
  - `EXIT 1` (issues found)
  - `EXIT 2` (could not complete due to tooling/access)
